This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and providing a keyExtractor function that does not return a unique key for each item. This results in unexpected behavior, such as incorrect rendering of items or performance issues.

```javascript
// Incorrect keyExtractor
<FlatList
  data={[{id: 1, name: 'Item 1'}, {id: 1, name: 'Item 2'}]}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  renderItem={({item}) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
/>
```

The above code will not render correctly because the keyExtractor returns the same key (1) for two different items, leading to React Native not being able to uniquely identify each item.
